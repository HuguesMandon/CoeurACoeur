# CoeurACoeur
Peer-to-peer, open-source, no-install dating site

## How to use it as a dating site
Should be pretty intuitive: you download it (or clone it if you can use git, it's easier for updates but far from mandatory), you should be able to browse profiles and complete yours.
This is however a work in progress, and is far from being complete (or even good at this point).

## The big TODO list
There is still a lot of work to do on this, hence why this TODO list exists:
### Short term, required functionalities:
- More robust p2p network
- Tchat, even video calls maybe?
- Matching algorithm and preferences (idea: Gale Shapley using clicks and likes to have the rankings, could even use some similar users clicks and likes?)
- Better location (gps?)
- Better filters
- Security: prevent user hacking, trojan and the likes
- Pictures?
### Longer term:
- Users security: prevent scams and bots
- Better interface
- More users' infos
- Improvements on matching algorithm / complementary algorithms (common interests, distance, common political beliefs, etc...)
- Maybe some way to create group events based on common interests and distance?
